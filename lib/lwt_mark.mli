(** This module uses Lwt thread storage to give threads "marks", which store thread id (some unique int, autogenerated),
    name (given by user, see [name] and [ignore_result]), parent thread name, and few (currently 10, may be changed) last log messages
    that was output from this thread using [Log] module.

    Thread mark is removed when the thread terminates.

    [summary ()] is the way to inspect current marks.

    Marking must be initialized ([init ()]) to work with marks.  When marking is not initialized, most of functions behave as no-op,
    this is implemented by checking [internal_flag : bool ref], so it's cheap.  There is no way to disable marking.

    There are no "links from current thread mark to parent thread mark" ( = no "call stack"), as it may grow infinitely in a perfectly
    working code that uses constant memory otherwise.

    Most of strings (names, logs) are lazy (internally), as their evaluation is needed only when one inspects current threads state.
    Functions that take strings wrap them with [Lazy.from_val].
  *)

(** Enables thread marking.  Use before calling other functions of this module. *)
val init : unit -> unit

val is_enabled : unit -> bool

(** [name n cont] creates new lwt thread [cont ()] marked with name [n].  Usage:

      let myfunc () =
        Lwt_mark.name "myfunc" @@ fun () ->
        <the_body>
 *)
val name : string -> (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt.t

(** [status lazy_name ?dump cont]

    Usage:

      lwt was_read =
        Lwt_mark.status (lazy (sprintf "reading %i bytes" to_read)) ~dump:string_of_int @@ fun () ->
        Lwt_unix.read fd buf ofs to_read
      in

    Start/exit of thread [cont ()] will be logged to parent thread's last logs.

    [lazy_name] must be able to be evaluated into a meaningful thread name when it is forced, no matter when (before thread startup, during
    thread execution, after thread exit).

    Use [?dump] argument when you need to log return value of the thread.

    Internally [status] works like [name], but statuses are groupped and displayed by [summary] in the section of thread that created them.

val status   : string Lazy.t -> ?dump:('a -> string) -> (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt.t
val status_s : string        -> ?dump:('a -> string) -> (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> 'a Lwt.t

(** [async name run_thread] works like [name] + [Lwt.async run_thread], but thread is marked as "background" (just for display purposes). *)
val async : string -> (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> unit

(** [ignore_result == async]. Deprecated.
    Note: this function takes argument [run_thread] that creates thread, not the thread itself, this differs from [Lwt.ignore_result].
    Reason: functions of this module may be used during evaluation of [(run_thread ()) : 'a Lwt.t], so we need to prepare Lwt thread
    storage before the evaluation of [(run_thread ())].
 *)
val ignore_result : string -> (unit -> 'a Lwt.t) -> unit

(** Adds line to current thread's last logs.
    When marking is enabled, but current thread is not marked/named, line is added to special "<top>" thread logs. *)
val log   : string        -> unit
val log_l : string Lazy.t -> unit

(** Human-readable marks summary: current running threads, their last logs and statuses. *)
val summary : unit -> string
